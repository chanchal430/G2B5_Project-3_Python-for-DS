# G2B5_Project-3_Python-for-DS
## Domain:
   â—‹ Finance and Banking.
## Context:
   - Dream Housing Finance company deals in all home loans. They have presence across all urban, semi urban and rural areas. Customers first apply for a home
loan after that company manually validates the customer eligibility for loan. Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process based on customer detail provided while filling the details online. They need a web application where a user can access their website and register, login, and enter the required details such as Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others for checking the eligibility for the home loan.
## Project Objective:
   1) This is a standard supervised classification task. A classification problem where we have to predict whether a customer is eligible for loan or not based on
a given set of independent variable(s).
   2) To build a Python Flask ML application where a user has to get registered by entering the username and password and login to the website and then enter
their details to check whether they are eligible for loan or not.
## Dataset Description:
   1. Dataset can be found in the project directory "loan_approval_data.csv"
   2. The parameter of the dataset is: Loan ID,gender, married, dependents,education, self_employed,  applicant_income,
                           coapplicant_income, loan_amount, loan_amount_term, credit_history, property_area

## Machine learning Model: 
   - It is built using '.ipynb' file from jupyter notebook.
## Prediction observations:
   - it is built using flask web framework and virtual enviroment aqs well.
## For reference and evidences:
 - one document file is attached with the project directory named 'Python_Project3_HouseLoanPricePredictionWebApplication_Evidences'.
 - The Project creeated from flask is in zip folder kindly compress it before use.
 - Direction to run the application is also provided in the evidence folder.
## Pyhthon flask web application.dcx:
  - file contains the full flask application with virtual environment
## python-graded-project-3-without-venv.zip:
  - This contains the flask web app without virtual environment
